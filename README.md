# Adversarial Vulnerability Testing for Language Models

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a structured approach to evaluating the robustness of language models against adversarial inputs. The core idea is to determine how small, controlled modifications to input text—generated through techniques like synonym replacement—affect the outputs of language models.

## Motivation

Language models are increasingly being deployed in critical applications, from customer service to content moderation. Understanding their vulnerabilities to adversarial inputs is essential for building more robust AI systems. This project provides a framework for systematically testing and quantifying these vulnerabilities.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preparation

The workflow begins with a dataset containing text samples along with metadata such as:
- Source information
- Complexity scores
- Sentiment analysis
- Word count

This foundation ensures we're working with diverse, real-world text examples before introducing adversarial perturbations.

### 2. Adversarial Example Generation

Using natural language processing techniques, we create slightly perturbed versions of the original text:
- **Synonym Replacement**: Words are replaced with their synonyms using NLTK's WordNet
- **Controlled Probability**: A fixed probability (e.g., 30%) determines which words are replaced
- **Meaning Preservation**: The goal is to maintain the original meaning while introducing subtle variations

### 3. Response Simulation

For both the original and adversarial inputs:
- Responses are simulated to mimic how a language model would process the text
- In a production environment, this would involve API calls to actual language models

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

We compute several metrics to quantify the impact of adversarial perturbations:
- **ROUGE-like Score**: Measures word overlap between responses to original and adversarial inputs
- **Length Ratio**: Compares the length of responses to identify significant variations
- **MAUVE-like Score**: A simplified version of semantic similarity measurement

### 5. Visualization & Analysis

Results are saved and visualized to provide clear insights:
- Comparative bar charts showing metrics across different samples
- CSV output for further analysis and record-keeping

## Sample Results

The framework has been tested on a variety of text samples, revealing interesting patterns:
- Some adversarial examples produce nearly identical responses (high robustness)
- Others lead to significantly different outputs despite minimal changes (potential vulnerabilities)
- Certain word replacements cause disproportionate changes in response length or content

## Technical Implementation

The project is implemented in Python, leveraging several key libraries:
- **pandas** for data handling and manipulation
- **NLTK** for natural language processing and WordNet access
- **matplotlib** for visualization of results

## Future Enhancements

This framework can be extended in several ways:
- Integration with actual LLM APIs for real-world testing
- Additional adversarial techniques beyond synonym replacement
- More sophisticated evaluation metrics
- Automated vulnerability detection and reporting
- Larger-scale testing across diverse text domains

## Usage

The workflow is designed to be modular and adaptable:
1. Load your text dataset
2. Generate adversarial examples
3. Process both original and adversarial inputs
4. Evaluate and visualize the results
5. Identify potential vulnerabilities for further investigation

## Conclusion

This adversarial testing framework provides valuable insights into language model robustness. By systematically evaluating how models respond to subtle perturbations, we can identify weaknesses and improve the reliability of AI systems in real-world applications.
